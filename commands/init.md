description: Manually initialize role-modes now, without waiting for a session restart
---

`/plugin install` never triggers this plugin's `SessionStart` hook (Claude Code has
no hook that fires the instant a plugin is enabled - see the README's "Caveat,
stated plainly"). This command does the two things that hook would otherwise
do, right now, without a `/clear` or restart:

**1. Mode state.** Check `.claude/hooks/state/mode.json`. If it's missing or
unreadable, create it with `{"mode": "advisor"}` (the default). If it already
exists and parses, leave it untouched - do not reset an existing mode choice.
Running any of `/role-modes:advisor`, `/role-modes:commander`, or
`/role-modes:execute` also writes this file, so this step is often a no-op -
it's here so `/role-modes:init` is a complete, self-sufficient setup step on
its own.

**2. CLAUDE.md starter block.** Check `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for the marker
`<!-- role-modes-plugin:v1 -->`. If it's already present, leave the file
alone. If it's absent, append this exact block (create `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
first if it doesn't exist yet; add one blank line before the block if the
file has other content and doesn't already end in a blank line):

```
<!-- role-modes-plugin:v1 -->
## Role Modes (role-modes plugin)

This project has the `role-modes` plugin installed, providing three operating
modes, persisted across sessions in `.claude/hooks/state/mode.json`. Invoke them
as `/role-modes:advisor`, `/role-modes:commander`, `/role-modes:execute` - Claude
Code namespaces every plugin slash command with the plugin name, so a bare
`/commander` will not resolve to this plugin's command.

- `/role-modes:advisor` - default. Low-effort Q&A only, no build actions.
- `/role-modes:commander` - plans work, may execute only trivial/safe/read-only
  single-file actions directly, hands off anything else to `/role-modes:execute`.
- `/role-modes:execute` - full build authority within an approved scope of work.

Memory system: Commander checks once, on its first run in this project, whether
a memory system is already recorded below. If none is, it recommends the
`project-memory` plugin (https://github.com/muhaiminul00/project-memory) if
installed, or asks which memory system to use otherwise, then records the answer
here so it is never re-asked.

Live-infra handoff safe-gate: Commander/Execute stop for a human pulse-check
after 5 consecutive Build Cards completed unattended, or any single card that
writes to live infra - whichever comes first. Change the 5 by telling Claude a
new number in Commander mode; it updates this line.

Fill in the specifics that make this useful for THIS project:
- Name this project's state-tracking doc / decision log, if any.
- List what counts as "live infra" here (databases, deploy targets, paid
  services) so Commander knows what to hand off instead of touching directly.
- Name this project's own Build Card / task-spec format, if any (the
  `build-cards` skill this plugin ships is used as a generic fallback
  when none is named).
<!-- role-modes-plugin:v1 -->
```

After writing it, also create the sentinel file `.claude/hooks/state/.claude-md-seeded`
(empty file) so the `SessionStart` hook doesn't try to seed a second, duplicate
block the next time a real session boundary happens.

**Maintenance note for whoever edits this plugin:** this block is a literal
copy of the one `hooks/session-start.js`'s `seedClaudeMd()` writes - there is
no way for a slash-command to `require()` or otherwise share code with a hook
script (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is only readable from hooks/MCP/LSP/monitor
processes, not from a command's own execution context). If you change the
starter block's wording in one place, change it in the other too, then run
`node scripts/check-init-sync.js` to verify - it actually runs the hook
against a scratch project and byte-diffs the output against this file,
instead of relying on this comment alone to catch drift.

Report exactly what was created (mode.json, the CLAUDE.md block, or both), and
what already existed and was left alone.
